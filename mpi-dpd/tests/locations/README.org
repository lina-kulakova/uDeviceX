I compile with the printing in dpd-forces.cu and main.cu enabled

out.x.txt store outputs of:
    > make -j slevel=-1 && ./test 1 1 1 -rbcs -tend=1000e-4 -steps_per_dump=1 -shrate=8 > tests/locations/out.x.txt

I plot them in gnuplot with
    > splot "<awk -f ../../../tools/bcut.awk out.1.txt" w p pt 6
They should look very similar, see out.1-2-3.png and out.1-wrong.png
